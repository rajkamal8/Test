<h1> don`t be afraid to be &lt;then a 100% success&gt; &amp; more</h1>
<p>
Having a cat can mean different things to different people.<br>
Some want a cat to cuddle and sit on their laps; others are happy to live with a very independent <br>
cat which spends most of its time outside and doesnâ€™t want too much human interaction.<br>

<br>What is important is that you try to find a cat that will interact<br>
with you if you want it to. All cats are not the same and how each<br>
individual cat behaves with you can depend on its inherent personality and early<br>
experiences (or lack of experiences), which can make it fearful or <br>
confident with people and life in general.
